      <h2 class="title">A colorful 2-column card layout with two breakpoints and Viking facts &#x1F4AB</h2>
      <div class="box4">
        <div class="flextest4" id="flextest4-1"><h3>Vikings didn’t wear horned helmets</h3><p> Forget almost every Viking warrior costume you’ve ever seen. Sure, the pugnacious Norsemen probably sported headgear, but that whole horn-festooned helmet look? Depictions dating from the Viking age don’t show it, and the only authentic Viking helmet ever discovered is decidedly horn-free. Painters seem to have fabricated the trend during the 19th century, perhaps inspired by descriptions of northern Europeans by ancient Greek and Roman chroniclers.</p></div>
        <div class="flextest4" id="flextest4-2"><h3>Vikings were known for their excellent hygiene</h3><p> Between rowing boats and decapitating enemies, Viking men must have stunk to high Valhalla, right? Quite the opposite. Excavations of Viking sites have turned up tweezers, razors, combs and ear cleaners made from animal bones and antlers. Vikings also bathed at least once a week—much more frequently than other Europeans of their day—and enjoyed dips in natural hot springs.</p></div>
        <div class="flextest4" id="flextest4-3"><h3>Vikings buried their dead in boats</h3><p>There’s no denying Vikings loved their boats—so much that it was a great honor to be interred in one. In the Norse religion, valiant warriors entered festive and glorious realms after death, and it was thought that the vessels that served them well in life would help them reach their final destinations. Distinguished raiders and prominent women were often laid to rest in ships, surrounded by weapons, valuable goods and sometimes even sacrificed slaves.</p></div>
        <div class="flextest4" id="flextest4-4"><h3>Viking women enjoyed some basic rights</h3><p> Viking girls got hitched as young as 12 and had to mind the household while their husbands sailed off on adventures. Still, they had more freedom than other women of their era. As long as they weren’t thralls, Viking women could inherit property, request a divorce and reclaim their dowries if their marriages ended.</p></div>
